# Project Brief: Comm

## Executive Summary

Comm is a cross-platform messaging application for busy startup founders, designed to prove that production-quality messaging infrastructure can be built with solid real-time sync and offline support. Inspired by WhatsApp's original simplicity and reliability, Comm focuses on core messaging fundamentals: instant message delivery under 300ms, rock-solid message persistence, optimistic UI updates, and seamless offline-to-online transitions. Built with React Native and Expo, with the backend architecture chosen for fastest time-to-market, Comm demonstrates that clean messaging architecture—not feature bloat—creates the best user experience for reliable communication.

## Problem Statement

### Current State and Pain Points

Busy startup founders need reliable, instant communication that works anywhere, anytime. They're constantly context-switching between meetings, calls, and urgent decisions. When they send a message, they expect:
- **Instant confirmation** - Did it send or not?
- **Complete reliability** - No lost messages, ever
- **Seamless offline handling** - Messages queue and send automatically when back online
- **Fast app launch** - Under 5 seconds from tap to ready
- **Smooth performance** - No lag, stuttering, or freezing

### Impact of the Problem

Poor messaging infrastructure creates:
- **Lost productivity** - Waiting for apps to load, messages to send, or sync to complete
- **Communication failures** - Dropped messages, unclear delivery status, sync conflicts
- **User frustration** - Laggy interfaces, app crashes, unclear connection status
- **Trust erosion** - When messages don't reliably deliver, users stop trusting the platform

### Why Existing Solutions Fall Short

Most messaging apps prioritize features over fundamentals:
- Complex feature sets add latency and bugs
- Poor offline handling causes sync conflicts
- Unclear connection states confuse users
- Slow launch times waste precious seconds
- Bloated apps consume excessive resources

### Urgency and Importance

Startup founders make dozens of time-sensitive decisions daily. A messaging app that "just works"—instantly, reliably, every time—becomes indispensable. The MVP must prove the infrastructure is solid before adding features.

## Proposed Solution

### Core Concept

Comm builds messaging infrastructure the right way: **real-time first, offline-resilient, optimistically updated**. Every architectural decision prioritizes:
1. **Message reliability** - Messages never get lost
2. **Perceived speed** - Optimistic UI makes everything feel instant
3. **Offline resilience** - App works seamlessly offline, syncs automatically
4. **Clean architecture** - Well-organized, maintainable code

### Key Differentiators

- **Infrastructure-first approach** - Prove the messaging core is bulletproof before adding features
- **Optimistic updates** - Messages appear instantly, then confirm delivery
- **Offline-first design** - Local-first storage with smart syncing
- **Performance obsession** - Sub-300ms message delivery, smooth scrolling for 200+ messages
- **Clean codebase** - Organized, secure, maintainable from day one

### Why This Solution Will Succeed

WhatsApp was originally built by two developers who focused relentlessly on infrastructure reliability. Comm follows the same philosophy: get the fundamentals perfect, then scale. By delivering a messaging app that:
- Always works, even offline
- Feels instant through optimistic updates
- Never loses messages
- Launches in under 5 seconds

...we create the foundation for a trusted communication platform.

### High-level Vision

Comm becomes the messaging app that "just works"—the one founders reach for when reliability matters. Clean architecture enables rapid feature additions post-MVP without technical debt.

## Technical Considerations

### Platform Requirements

- **Target Platforms:** iOS and Android (via React Native + Expo)
- **Testing Platforms:** 
  - Primary: Expo Go on iOS devices
  - Fallback: Local iOS/Android simulators/emulators
  - Must support multiple simultaneous users
- **Performance Requirements:**
  - Message delivery: < 300ms latency
  - App launch: < 5 seconds
  - Scroll performance: 60fps for 200+ messages
  - Reconnection: 2-3 seconds after offline

### Technology Preferences

- **Frontend:** 
  - React Native with Expo SDK
  - Expo Router for navigation
  - Expo SQLite for local message persistence
  - Expo Notifications for foreground push notifications

- **Backend:** 
  - **Architect's choice:** Firebase suite (Firestore, Auth, FCM) OR custom backend
  - **Decision criteria:** SPEED OF BUILD - choose whichever approach ships fastest
  - **Cloud Functions:** Architect decides if FCM Cloud Functions needed or if client-side only is faster
  - Firebase Authentication OR custom auth (architect decides based on speed)

- **Database:**
  - Expo SQLite for local, offline storage (required)
  - Cloud database: Firestore OR custom database (architect's choice for fastest build)
  - Approach: Local-first with cloud sync

- **Hosting/Infrastructure:**
  - Architect chooses fastest deployment path
  - Firebase OR custom backend infrastructure
  - Priority: Get something working quickly, optimize later

### Architecture Considerations

- **Repository Structure:** 
  - Single monorepo for mobile app
  - Clear separation: screens, components, hooks, services, utils
  - Firebase config isolated and secured

- **Service Architecture:**
  - Real-time sync (Firestore listeners OR WebSocket - architect decides for speed)
  - Optimistic updates: Local write first, sync to cloud
  - Offline queue: Store unsent messages locally, auto-send on reconnect
  - Presence system: Online/offline status tracking (approach TBD by architect)
  - **Priority:** Choose whatever architecture ships fastest

- **Integration Requirements:**
  - Expo APIs for SQLite, Notifications, and device features (required)
  - Backend integration: Firebase SDK OR custom API (architect decides)
  - Authentication integration (approach TBD by architect)
  - **Goal:** Fastest path to working multi-user messaging

- **Security/Compliance:**
  - API keys never exposed in app (use Expo secure environment variables)
  - Backend access control (Firebase Security Rules OR custom auth - architect decides)
  - Authentication required for all message operations
  - User data isolated per authenticated user

## Constraints & Assumptions

### Constraints

- **Budget:** Free tier services only (Firebase Spark plan, Expo free tier)
- **Timeline:** No specific deadline—focus on quality over speed
- **Resources:** Small team, AI-assisted development
- **Technical:**
  - Must use Expo (no React Native CLI or bare workflow)
  - Backend choice: Architect decides (Firebase OR custom) based on fastest build time
  - Expo Go deployment preferred (no native builds if possible)
  - No background notification support in MVP
  - Cloud Functions: Architect decides if needed

### Key Assumptions

- Users have stable internet connectivity most of the time (occasional offline periods expected)
- iOS devices are primary testing platform (Android secondary)
- Startup founders are tech-savvy users who understand MVP limitations
- Multiple concurrent users will stress-test infrastructure during MVP phase
- Backend costs (if any) manageable during MVP testing phase
- Expo Go limitations acceptable for MVP (native module restrictions)
- Group chats will have 3-5 users maximum during MVP testing

## Risks & Open Questions

### Key Risks

- **Backend costs:** If using paid services, costs could grow with usage
  - *Mitigation: Monitor usage closely; architect chooses cost-effective approach*

- **Message ordering:** When users send messages simultaneously while offline, messages queue locally and send when reconnected
  - *Approach: Use timestamps to sort messages in chat view; re-sorting is acceptable and should be performant*

- **Expo Go limitations:** Some native features may not work in Expo Go
  - *Mitigation: Fallback to simulator testing; design around Expo Go constraints*

- **Push notification reliability:** Expo Notifications may have delivery quirks
  - *Mitigation: Test extensively; document known issues; fallback to polling if needed*

### Open Questions

- What's our approach to handling very poor network connections (2G, high latency)?
- Do we need a "force refresh" button if sync gets stuck, or should it always auto-recover?
- Should we implement any message delivery retry logic, or rely on the backend's built-in retry?

### Areas Needing Further Research

- **Backend security best practices** for messaging apps (whichever backend is chosen)
- **Expo SQLite performance** with growing message counts
- **Optimistic update patterns** for group chat scenarios
- **Backend query optimization** to ensure fast message delivery
- **Offline queue patterns** to handle extended offline periods
