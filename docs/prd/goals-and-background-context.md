# Goals and Background Context

## Goals

- **Prove messaging infrastructure reliability** through real-time sync, optimistic updates, and offline resilience
- **Deliver sub-300ms message latency** for all online users with instant perceived send speed
- **Achieve 100% message persistence** across app restarts, force-quits, and device reboots
- **Enable multi-user testing** with simultaneous users experiencing smooth, crash-free performance
- **Establish clean architecture foundation** for rapid post-MVP feature development
- **Demonstrate offline-first design** with automatic message queueing and sync recovery
- **Deploy to Expo Go** for real-world multi-device testing

## Background Context

Busy startup founders need communication tools that work reliably under any conditions. WhatsApp demonstrated that two developers could build messaging infrastructure serving billions by focusing on fundamentals: instant delivery, offline resilience, and message persistence. Comm follows this philosophy, building production-quality messaging infrastructure before adding features.

The MVP focuses exclusively on proving the core messaging architecture is solid. By implementing real-time sync via Firebase Firestore, local persistence with Expo SQLite, optimistic UI updates, and robust offline handling, we create a foundation that can scale to support advanced features post-MVP. The success of this MVP is measured not by feature count, but by infrastructure reliability.
