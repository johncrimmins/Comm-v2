# User Interface Design Goals

## Overall UX Vision

Comm prioritizes **clarity, speed, and reliability** over visual complexity. The interface should feel familiar to anyone who has used messaging apps, with standard patterns: conversation list, chat view, message composition. Visual design emphasizes:

- **Clear connection status** - Users always know if they're online or offline
- **Instant feedback** - Every action (send message, open chat) feels immediate
- **Minimal friction** - Fast navigation, responsive keyboard, smooth scrolling
- **Clean aesthetics** - Uncluttered interface focused on content (messages)

## Key Interaction Paradigms

- **Optimistic updates** - Messages appear instantly when sent, update with delivery confirmation
- **Pull-to-refresh** - Manual sync trigger if automatic sync seems stuck
- **Swipe gestures** - Standard mobile patterns (swipe to go back)
- **Keyboard optimization** - Smart keyboard handling, no lag or freezing
- **Real-time updates** - Messages from others appear instantly without refresh

## Core Screens and Views

1. **Authentication Screen** - Sign up / Sign in with display name
2. **Conversation List Screen** - All conversations (one-on-one and groups) with last message preview
3. **Chat Screen** - Individual conversation view with message history and composition
4. **New Conversation Screen** - Select user(s) to start new chat or group
5. **Connection Status Indicator** - Persistent visual indicator of online/offline/reconnecting state (potentially a banner or header element)

## Accessibility

Accessibility: Basic (MVP focus on core functionality)
- Text should be readable with system font scaling
- Color contrast meets basic readability standards
- Interactive elements have sufficient touch target size (44x44pt minimum)

Post-MVP will address WCAG AA compliance.

## Branding

**MVP Branding:** Minimal and functional
- Simple, clean interface
- Standard iOS/Android design patterns
- Focus on usability over custom branding

No custom branding required for MVP. Post-MVP can introduce logo, custom colors, and brand identity.

## Target Device and Platforms

**Primary:** iOS via Expo Go  
**Secondary:** iOS Simulator  
**Stretch:** Android via Expo Go (if time permits, but not required for MVP gate)

Responsive design for various phone sizes (iPhone SE to iPhone Pro Max). No tablet or desktop optimization in MVP.
