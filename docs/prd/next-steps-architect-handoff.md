# Next Steps & Architect Handoff

This PRD is now ready for the **Architect** to review and create the technical architecture document.

**Architect Focus Areas:**
1. **Data models:** Firestore document structures and SQLite schema
2. **Real-time sync:** Firestore listener patterns and sync logic
3. **Offline handling:** Message queueing and conflict resolution strategy
4. **Performance optimization:** FlatList virtualization, pagination, query optimization
5. **Security:** Firebase Security Rules, API key management
6. **Project structure:** Folder organization, code patterns, state management

**Key Technical Decisions for Architect:**
- State management approach (React Context + Hooks vs. Redux/Zustand)
- Firebase SDK choice (JS SDK vs. native packages)
- Offline persistence strategy (Firestore offline + SQLite dual approach)
- Presence system implementation (Firestore vs. Realtime Database)
- Message pagination strategy
- Push notification integration details
