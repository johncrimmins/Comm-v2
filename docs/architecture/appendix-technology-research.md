# Appendix: Technology Research

## Firebase + Expo Integration

**Maturity:** Production-ready  
**Documentation:** Excellent (official Firebase docs + Expo docs)  
**Community:** Large, active community with many messaging app examples  
**Known Issues:** None blocking for MVP

## Expo SQLite

**Maturity:** Stable (used in many production apps)  
**Performance:** Adequate for 10K+ messages with proper indexing  
**Limitations:** No full-text search (can add post-MVP with separate library)  
**Alternative Considered:** WatermelonDB (more complex, unnecessary for MVP)

## Firestore for Messaging

**Pros:**
- Real-time listeners (onSnapshot) provide instant updates
- Built-in offline persistence
- Scales automatically
- Security Rules for authorization

**Cons:**
- Costs scale with usage (mitigated by free tier for MVP)
- Eventual consistency (acceptable for messaging)

**Conclusion:** Excellent choice for MVP messaging infrastructure
