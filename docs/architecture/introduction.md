# Introduction

This document outlines the complete fullstack architecture for **Comm**, a cross-platform messaging application built with React Native and Firebase. It serves as the single source of truth for AI-driven development, ensuring consistency across the mobile frontend, backend-as-a-service (Firebase), and their integration.

This architecture is designed to prove that production-quality messaging infrastructure can be built with solid real-time sync, offline support, and optimistic UI updates. Every architectural decision prioritizes **message reliability, perceived speed, and offline resilience**.

## Starter Template or Existing Project

**N/A - Greenfield project**

We are building from scratch using Expo's managed workflow with TypeScript. No starter template is being used to ensure complete control over the messaging infrastructure architecture.
