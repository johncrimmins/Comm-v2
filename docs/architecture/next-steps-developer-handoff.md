# Next Steps & Developer Handoff

This architecture document is ready for implementation. Development should proceed in the epic order defined in the PRD:

## Epic 1: Foundation & Authentication
- Set up Expo project structure
- Configure Firebase
- Implement auth screens and service
- Set up basic navigation

## Epic 2: One-on-One Messaging Core
- Implement SQLite service
- Build conversation list with Firestore sync
- Create chat screen with message display
- Implement send message with optimistic updates
- Add real-time sync engine
- Implement offline queueing
- Add read receipts and presence

## Epic 3: Group Chat
- Extend conversation model for groups
- Implement group creation flow
- Update chat screen for group display
- Add group read receipts

## Epic 4: Polish & Deployment
- Add foreground push notifications
- Optimize performance (FlatList, pagination)
- Improve keyboard handling
- Deploy to Expo Go
- Multi-user testing validation

## Key Implementation Priorities

1. **Services Layer First:** Build and test services independently before UI
2. **SQLite Before UI:** Set up local database and test queries before hooking up to React components
3. **Firebase Integration Early:** Connect Firebase Auth and Firestore in first epic to validate setup
4. **Test Offline Scenarios Frequently:** Constantly test airplane mode and force-quit scenarios
5. **Performance Benchmarks:** Measure latency and scroll performance throughout development

## Architectural Decisions to Validate During Implementation

- **State management:** If Context becomes unwieldy, consider Zustand (lightweight alternative to Redux)
- **Presence system:** Firestore-based presence vs. Firebase Realtime Database (evaluate based on accuracy needs)
- **Message pagination:** 50 initial messages sufficient? May need tuning based on UX
- **Sync frequency:** Real-time listeners vs. periodic polling for certain operations
